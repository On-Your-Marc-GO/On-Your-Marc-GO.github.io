# Bootcamp: Homework 2 - Personal Portfolio Page

# Live URL

[Marc's Porfolio](https://on-your-marc-go.github.io/)

## Description

This project serves as a personal portfolio for the remainder of my developement work as I progress through the coding bootcamp. As time progresses, this portfolio may be added to and expounded upon to reflect new knowledge as I acquire it. This portfolio will hopefully make it very easy for fellow devs or future employers to see what I'm all about.

This page is meant showcase just a bit of personality. At heart, I'm an avid runner and the imagery is bright to showcase that while other elements such as the navbar and footer are dark so as not to be the focus. All components added to this page were done so utilizing the Bootstrap framework with slight modifications coming by way of an external css style sheet.

Future plans for the site include, but are not limited to:

- Added Contact Info
- Links to possible Blog content
- Addtion of CSV and Resume access
- Full fledged form functionality
